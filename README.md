# GiantBomb for Node.js

This entirely unofficial project serves as a wrapper for the GiantBomb API. It's meant to cut boilerplate code and reduce friction when getting the API integrated with your project.

It also aims to provide a simplified and consistent interface, more robust documentation, and some healthy JavaScript sheen over a few bumps and cracks.

### Documentation
